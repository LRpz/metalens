# MetaLens: Codebase for Super-Resolved Spatial Metabolomics

This repository contains the codebase for the paper titled [**"Inferring super-resolved spatial metabolomics from microscopy"**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.29.610242v1).

## Overview

MetaLens is a tool for generating super-resolved spatial metabolomics data from microscopy images. The codebase and accompanying datasets allow users to replicate and extend the experiments presented in the associated research paper.

MetaLens provides a user-friendly Napari plugin for no-code inference. For detailed installation and usage instructions, please refer to our [User Guide](https://lrpz.github.io/metalens/user_guide/).
